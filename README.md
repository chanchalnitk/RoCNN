Development of Robust CNN Architecture for Grading and Classification of Renal Cell Carcinoma Histology Images.

The proposed architecture integrates squeeze-and-excitation (SE) channel attention blocks with convolutional layers to enhance feature discrimination. Unlike standard SE-ResNet blocks that use fixed kernel sizes, the proposed model incorporates Inception-ResNet modules to extract multi-scale features, enabling robust detection across diverse nuclear morphologies. To further enrich the feature representation, an additional Inception-ResNet block is cascaded after the SE-Inception-ResNet module, refining the attention-enhanced outputs. The final classification leverages a hypercolumn network, which aggregates multi-level features from various depths of the network. This fusion emphasizes both low-level and high-level spatial details crucial for accurate grading. The complete architecture ensures improved feature localization, class separability, and adaptability across histological variations.
